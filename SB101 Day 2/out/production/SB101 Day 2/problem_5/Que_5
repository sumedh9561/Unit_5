
Q5)Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded Wildcards with Example.

Ans :-

      * Upper Bounded Wildcards

      => ? extends T : In Upper bounded wildcard only T or its subtypes will be supported. For example
         we have an Animal class and have Dog , Cat as its subtypes. So following generic methods will
         only accept parameters of type Data<Animal>, Data<Dog> and Data<Cat>

      EX.
          public static void add(Data<? extends Animal> animalData) {

          }


     * Lower Bounded Wildcards

      => ? super T : In Lower-bounded wildcard only T or its super types will be supported. Same example
         we used for defining Lower-bounded Wildcard. Lets say we have Animal class as super or parent class
         and Dog as its child class. Now below method use Lower-bounded Wildcard and will only accept parameters
         of type


       EX.
            Data<Animal>, Data<Dog> and  Data<Object>

            public static void add(Data<? super Dog> animalData) {

            }
