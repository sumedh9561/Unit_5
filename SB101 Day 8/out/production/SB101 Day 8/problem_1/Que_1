
Q1) What do you mean by Multithreading? Why is it important?

ans:
Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in
parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A
simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
But, if the programming language supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
in parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and multithreading, both are
used to achieve multitasking.

multithreading important in Java
Multithreading saves time as you can perform multiple operations together. The threads are independent, so it does not
block the user to perform multiple operations at the same time and also, if an exception occurs in a single thread, it does
not affect other threads
