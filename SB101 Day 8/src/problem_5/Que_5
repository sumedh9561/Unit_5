
Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread?

ans:
Thread
Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread
It has multiple methods including start() and run()
Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it
More memory required ,Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java
hence after a class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class

Example of Thread
class ThreadExample extends Thread{
   public void run(){
      System.out.println("Thread is running");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
      ThreadExample t1=new ThreadExample ();
      t1.start();
   }
}

Runnable
Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread
It has only abstract method run(),Multiple threads share the same objects.
Less memory required ,If a class is implementing the runnable interface
then your class can extend another class.


Example of Runnable
class RunnableExample implements Runnable{
   public void run(){
      System.out.println("Thread is running for Runnable Implementation");
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
      RunnableExample runnable=new RunnableExample();
      Thread t1 =new Thread(runnable);
      t1.start();
   }
}
