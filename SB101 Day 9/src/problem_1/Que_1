
Q1) What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block?

 *Synchronized method =>

      Synchronized methods enable a simple strategy for preventing thread interference
      and memory consistency errors: if an object is visible to more than one thread,
      all reads or writes to that object's variables are done through synchronized methods.

 *Synchronized block =>

      A Synchronized block is a piece of code that can be used to perform synchronization
      on any specific resource of the method. A Synchronized block is used to lock an object
      for any shared resource and the scope of a synchronized block is smaller than the synchronized
      method.
