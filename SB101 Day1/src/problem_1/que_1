
Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().


Answer: PriorityQueue() can be found inside Queue() where LinkedList() can  be found in both
Queue() as well as List().
both of htese are from java.util package

as we are comparing PriorityQueue() whith linkedlist() we will compare according to LinkedList() preset in Queue().

in case of PriorityQueue() its main objective is to print its element in sorted order
where LinkedList() in queque() is not perticulrly used for sorting ,it gives n number of extra methods wich helps in LIKE:
accesing/deleting first element .
accesing/deleting Last element.

it gives a method called remove() witch can directly remove that perticular element from list;

we can use above method by using Itrator().
