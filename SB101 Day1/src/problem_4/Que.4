
Q4: Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example

The Java Generics allows us to create a single class, interface, and method that can be used with different types of data (objects).

This helps us to reuse our code.

Note: Generics does not work with primitive types (int, float, char, etc).

class GenericsClass<T> {...}
Here, T used inside the angle bracket <> indicates the type parameter. Inside the Main class, we have created two objects of GenericsClass

intObj - Here, the type parameter T is replaced by Integer. Now, the GenericsClass works with integer data.
stringObj - Here, the type parameter T is replaced by String. Now, the GenericsClass works with string data.
