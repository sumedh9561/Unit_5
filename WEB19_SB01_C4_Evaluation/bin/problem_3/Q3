

There are 3 types of relationships. 

1)one to one
2) one to many
3) many to many

1:One to One:


 When one record in the first table relates to only one record in the second table and vice versa
 
 It is used to create a relationship between two tables in 
 which a single row of the first table can only be related to one and only one records of a second table. Similarly
  the row of a second table can also be related to anyone row of the first table.
  
  example:
  
 example: 
 Assume that Table A contains general data of 
 students like Name,Surname,id card number, address etc. And Table B contains their 
 total yearly grades at school. And to be able to track which grade belongs which student we have same 
 id card number column on Table B too. we need total yearly grade record of student, we 
 can access it using its id card number to search on Table B. 
 
 

2:One to Many:

One record in the first table relates to many records in the second table but one record of the 
second table can only relate to one record of the 
first table

example:
we may have one to many relationship between a person and 
bank account where one person can have many 
bank accounts but a bank account can only have one specific owner



3:many to many:
One record in the first table relates to many records in the second table and vice versa


example:
student and course where one student can take many 
courses and each course can be taken by many students.
